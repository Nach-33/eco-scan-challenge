   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables and Secret Files**
   1. Create .env file in backend and provide your environment variables.
   ```env
      PORT = 4000
      API_URI = http://localhost:4000/api
      FRONTEND_URI = http://localhost:3000
      USER_AUTH_REDIRECT_URI = http://localhost:4000/api/user/auth/redirect
      MONGO_URI = [YOUR MONGODB CONNECTION URI STRING]
      OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = [YOUR GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE PROJECT OAUTH_CLIENT_ID]
      OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = [YOUR GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE PROJECT OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET]
      JWT_SECRET = [YOUR JWT_SECRET]
      FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET = [YOUR FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_URI]
   ```

   2. Add firebase-adminsdk.json downloaded from your firebase cloud console storage settings in backend root directory.

   3. Create .env file in frontend and provide your environment variables.
   ```env
      VITE_APP_VERSION=v1.0.0
      GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false

      ## Backend API URL
      PUBLIC_URL = https://mantisdashboard.io/
      VITE_APP_BASE_NAME = /
      VITE_APP_BACKEND_URI = http://localhost:4000/api
      VITE_APP_FRONTEND_URI = http://localhost:3000/
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   - **Backend**: Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - **Frontend**: Start the frontend application:
     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```

## üå± Carbon Score Assumptions

To calculate the environmental impact of each clothing item, we have assigned approximate carbon scores based on item type. These scores are stored in an in-memory dictionary for quick access.

| üëï Item       | üåç Estimated Carbon Score (kg CO‚ÇÇ) |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| T-shirt      | 5                                  |
| Jeans        | 10                                 |
| Jacket       | 15                                 |
| Shoes        | 8                                  |
