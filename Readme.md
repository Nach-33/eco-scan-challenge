## 🌱 Carbon Score Assumptions

To calculate the environmental impact of each clothing item, we have assigned approximate carbon scores based on item type. These scores are stored in an in-memory dictionary for quick access.

| 👕 Item       | 🌍 Estimated Carbon Score (kg CO₂) |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| T-shirt      | 5                                  |
| Jeans        | 10                                 |
| Jacket       | 15                                 |
| Shoes        | 8                                  |
